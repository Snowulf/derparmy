###The "Making Of" for https://derp.army
Why did I do it? Just to stretch my hosting legs and have a chance to play with a little javascript.

-----
* The single html & js page are hosted on https://derp.army for you to play with
* How I host this site is covered at https://snowulf.com/2014/12/06/hosting-a-website-for-0-10-a-month/

License note: I've included a license of CC0 for the work that I did. However I don't claim ownership to the images (commonly available on net) or original code (didn't include a license on the page).  So... do with it what you will, this is just my attempt at a fun little project.
